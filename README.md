#Fituring project
This project was done within the PACT Project at Telecom ParisTech (informations available here : https://pact.wp.imt.fr)
We designed and built a prototype that we called “Fituring” which makes it possible to create music in rhythm with the user’s body movements, thanks to a Kinect.

A full report is available on fituring/report.pdf
